## Northwind Datasets for Spark ##

### What it is
* A fork of https://github.com/tmcnab/northwind-mongo
* Just a simple data dump from SQL's Northwind database to a CSV
* CSV (northwind.csv) turned into multiple CSVs
* Scripts to create Dataframes/tables in Apache Spark

### What it needs

* There aren't any employee/product images
* It's a straight data dump - no relations or special magic
